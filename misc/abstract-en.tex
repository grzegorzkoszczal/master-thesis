\chapter*{Abstract}

% \begin{otherlanguage}{english}

The goal of the project is to conduct experiments and compare various methods
of power draw measurement of parallel applications. The used measurement
tools are both software (Intel RAPL, NVIDIA NVML) and hardware
(Yokogawa WT310E). Moreover, the conditions of implementing mentioned
solutions are evaluated, as well as their limitations for newest CPUs and GPUs.
