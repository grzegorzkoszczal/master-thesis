What has been achieved:
1.  Work is re-written in LaTeX: You can ask supervisor if
    this format is acceptable
2.  Tests have been performed on university cluster
    (sanna.kask) using command below:
    taskset --cpu-list 0-15 perf stat -e power/energy-cores/,power/energy-gpu/,power/energy-pkg/ ./ft.C



What is already planned to do / questions to the supervisor:
1.  Add the preliminary tests from presentation, about
    choosing the correct CPU benchmarks as well as correct
    class sizes. (as a preliminary tests section, maybe
    shout-out to my local rig? She deserved it :3 )
1.  Ask about the configurations. Are they sufficient? Or we
    plan to run the tests on 2 nodes using 2 power meters
    (may require additional software such as pssh)
2.  Ask about the status of the current power meter (old one)
    and the status / plans for the second power meter.
3.  Ask the administrator of the servers to install rest
    of the necessary software (parallel-ssh in order to
    work and run benchmarks on two nodes, pip in order
    to re-install yoko-tool software for )


What to do next (conclusions after consultations):
